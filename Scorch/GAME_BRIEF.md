## High Concept

> **"Master the art of destruction in this turn-based artillery battle where precision, strategy, and physics combine on fully destructible terrain."**

Scorched Earth is a modernized remake of the classic 1991 DOS artillery game. Players control tanks on a 2D landscape, using realistic physics to calculate trajectories and eliminate opponents with an extensive arsenal of devastating weapons. Every shot reshapes the battlefield, creating emergent tactical situations.

## Core Gameplay

### The Three Pillars

1. **Physics-Based Combat**
   - Realistic ballistic trajectories affected by wind, gravity, and terrain
   - Every player must master angle, power, and environmental factors
   - High skill ceiling with room for creative solutions

2. **Destructible Environments**
   - All terrain is fully destructible and deformable
   - Weapons create craters, add dirt, or remove ground
   - Dynamic battlefield that changes with every shot

3. **Strategic Resource Management**
   - Limited funds to purchase weapons and utilities
   - Balance offensive firepower with defensive equipment
   - Economic choices directly impact tactical options

### Gameplay Loop

```
Purchase Equipment → Aim Your Shot → Fire Weapon → Terrain Destruction → Next Turn
```

Players take turns buying weapons, aiming their tank cannon, and firing at opponents. Success requires:
- Understanding projectile physics
- Adapting to changing terrain
- Managing limited resources
- Outthinking opponents
